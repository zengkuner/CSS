    <p class="p1">Thomas Jefferson and James Madison met in 1776.Could it have been any other year?
         They worked together starting then to further American Revolution and later to shape the new scheme
          of government. From the work sprang a friendship perhaps incomparable in intimacy1 and the 
          trustfulness of collaboration2 and induration. It lasted 50 years. It included pleasure and utility
           but over and above them, there were shared purpose, a common end and an enduring goodness on both 
           sides. Four and a half months before he died, when he was ailing3, debt-ridden, and worried about 
           his impoverished4 family, Jefferson wrote to his longtime friend. His words and Madison's reply 
           remind us that friends are friends until death. They also remind us that sometimes a friendship has
            a bearing on things larger than the friendship itself, for has there ever been a friendship of 
            greater public consequence than this one?
